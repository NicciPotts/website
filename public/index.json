[{"categories":["Sport \u0026 physical activity"],"contents":"Exploring why people who live in more deprived areas are less likely to take part in sport and physical activity.\nScotland has a deprivation-related sport and physical activity gap.\n All views, analysis, and summaries in this post are my personal work and opinions. The R code for my data wrangling and plots can be found on GitHub.\n This problem isn\u0026rsquo;t unique to Scotland, there are examples of poverty-related sport/physical activity gaps across the globe. Each country will have it\u0026rsquo;s own unique challenges but some potential barriers (and solutions) may also be universal.\n The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is an index of relative deprivation. It sections Scotland into around 7k datazones with roughly equivalent population sizes. These areas are then ranked against 7 risk domains (access to services, crime, education, employment, health, housing, income) and divided into quintiles. Areas that rank highest against multiple domains are described as the most deprived areas of Scotland (quintile 1).\n \rData from the Scottish Household Survey shows us:\n There is a correlation between increasing SIMD quintile and increasing sport/physical activity participation (i.e. decreasing levels of deprivation leads to increasing participation in sport/physical activity). Those that live in the most deprived areas of Scotland (SIMD quintile 1) are less likely to participate in sport/physical activity compared to those in the least deprived areas (SIMD quintile 5).  While poverty does not equal deprivation, there are strong ties between those who are on low-incomes living in areas of high deprivation. This makes the leap to financial barriers to participation a small one to make.\nUndoubtedly finances are a barrier to sport/physical activity participation. Sport and physical activity are not free. People will regularly claim going for a run costs nothing. They are wrong. If you want to do any outdoor activity in Scotland 12 months of the year, multiple times a week, you need to invest in some gear (especially waterproofs!). The only potential exception to this is walking.\nWalking up hills or mountaineering is certainly not free but going for a walk around your neighborhood or local park does not require the same financial investment as other activities. So why then is there a big difference in participation between the most and least deprived areas?\n\rIt is not unsurprising to see the breakdown of individual activity participation also show differences between SIMD quintiles, however;\n Not all sport/activities show a significant difference between SIMD quintile 1 and SIMD quintile 5 participation (bowls and snooker for example). There isn\u0026rsquo;t a difference between traditionally indoor or facility based sports (swimming, golf, bowls, gym) and outdoor sports (football, running, cycling). The biggest absolute difference is in walking (the biggest proportional differences are golf, running, then walking).  As walking participation is so high for both SIMD quintiles, increasing SIMD quintile 1 participation to match that of SIMD quintile 5 would pretty much eliminate the deprivation-related physical activity gap.\nSo the solution is to get people more walking.\nWell, not quite! By saying we need to get more people walking we place the onus on the individual. Interventions or campaigns to highlight the benefits of sport/physical activity aim to educate/inspire individuals to encourage their participation, but do they consider external factors? (i.e. the barrier isn\u0026rsquo;t with person but with the circumstance!).\nI wanted to test a hypothesis;\nPeople who live in areas of higher deprivation have:\n less access to green space increased problems in their neighborhoods.  which discourages participation in walking.\n\rOn my first point, I was wrong.\n The majority of people across all SIMD quintiles have less than a 10 minute walk to a green space. While there is variation across the local authorities, the lowest values are in SIMD quintile 4 (which has high walking participation).  But on my second point, I was correct.\n\r More people in SIMD quintile 1 report problems in their neighborhoods compared to those who live in SIMD quintile 5. (i.e. there are more problems in more deprived areas). Rubbish and animal nuisances are fairly common in both SIMD quintiles but there are greater amounts of vandalism, rowdy behavior, drugs, and harassment in SIMD quintile 1. (i.e. the problems which are more likely to make a person feel unsafe are proportionally larger in more deprived areas).  In addition, in 2019 8% of people in the most deprived areas had experienced harassment (10% discrimination) compared to 5% of people in the least deprived areas (6% discrimination).\nSo how does this impact on people\u0026rsquo;s ratings of their neighborhoods?\n\r People who live in SIMD quintile 5 (least deprived) are more likely to rate their neighborhoods as \u0026lsquo;very/fairly good\u0026rsquo; compared to those who live in SIMD quintile 1 (most deprived). And so there is a correlation between increasing rating of neighborhoods as \u0026lsquo;very/fairly good\u0026rsquo; and increased walking participation. The biggest variation in high neighborhood ratings, across local authorities, is in SIMD quintile 2 with decreasing variation to SIMD quintile 5 (i.e. people in SIMD quintile 5 unanimously rate their neighborhoods highly compared to the other SIMD quintiles.)  However, 85% of the SIMD quintile 1 population still rate their neighborhoods as \u0026lsquo;very/fairly good\u0026rsquo;, with only 4% rating their neighborhoods as very poor. That\u0026rsquo;s an overwhelming majority of people rating their neighborhoods highly!\nWith the data suggesting that while people living in the most deprived areas are more likely to have experienced harassment/discrimination, as well as, problems in their neighborhood, they are also less likely to let this impact their rating of their neighborhood as a place to live.\nAs 8.5 out of 10 people from SIMD quintile 1 rate their neighborhoods as \u0026lsquo;very/fairly good\u0026rsquo; and 6 out of 10 people take part in walking, there are still people who rate their neighborhoods highly that don\u0026rsquo;t participation in walking.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s throw something else into the mix; in the UK people on low incomes are more likely to work non-standard hours (compared to those on higher incomes). They are also more likely to have care commitments, work multiple jobs, and have less access to childcare (Caroline Criado Perez covers this really well in her book Invisible Women).\n 28% of those in most deprived have no childcare compared to 10% least deprived. Of those in the most deprived areas 50% use local authority nurseries for childcare (34% least deprived). While 48% of the least deprived use private nursery provision (13% most deprived).\n So now take those problems that are more likely to be met in the most deprived areas, then add evenings, nighttime, or early mornings. My assumption would be people are less likely to use parks for recreation or walk the streets late at night/in the dark, especially if they have experienced or witnessed problems in their area!\nSo what does this mean for sport and physical activity?\nIf we want people to utilize community space more, does this have to come hand-in-hand with other measures to reduce anti-social behavior? (does an increase in people using their neighborhoods for leisure lead to a reduction in anti-social behavior?) And do those measures have to work on a 24hr clock rather than targeting peak times based on a standard 9-5 schedule?\nI looked specifically at walking here but the same deprivation-gap exists for other sports. Do leisure facilities and sport clubs cater for people who work non-standard hours?\n The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that \u0026ldquo;up to 5 million deaths a year could be averted if the global population was more active\u0026rdquo;.\n Of course, people who live in high areas of deprivation are not a homogeneous group and there are a multitude of potential barriers to participation. However, there is an uncomfortable truth that systems with inherent deprivation-related inequalities have evolved to serve a more privileged society. If we have systems with historically under represented groups, then those system have historically not been designed, built, and/or evolved with under represented groups in mind, by default.\nMaybe by diversifying participation in sport/physical activity the system will itself, over time, evolve to reflect the diversifying needs of all subsets of society. But would we see quicker reduction of inequality gaps by adapting the system for the individual, rather than the individual adapting for the system?\nSummary image by Kasuma from Pexels\n","permalink":"https://niccipotts.netlify.app/blog/deprivationandsport/","tags":["R","Physical activity","Social survey data"],"title":"The deprivation-related sport gap"},{"categories":["R"],"contents":"Mapping census data in R to show how we can use data to put people at the heart of decision making.\nAt the risk of being repetitive, in this blog post I\u0026rsquo;m going to be mapping social data for Scotland. This time, however, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use Scotland\u0026rsquo;s census data and the leaflet package.\nCensus data is a gold-mine of information, and I want to show how it can be used as a tool when looking at where we place provisions and facilities.\nAs an example, I\u0026rsquo;m going to map the number of people with one or more long-term health conditions in each output area (read: neighbourhoods) and overlay this with the location of 2021 polling stations.\n The Electoral Commission states that everyone should be able to register and cast their vote without facing barriers. They should be able to vote on their own and in secret.\n Scotland Census data I have to be honest, I find the Scotland Census website an absolute maze and the process for accessing the data \u0026hellip; non-trivial. But, I have cracked a method that works for me.\nThere is a table builder but you have to manually enter output area codes (with no copy and pasting), a massively time consuming task if you want data for the whole of Scotland or even a whole local authority.\n Output areas are the lowest geographical level at which census estimates are provided. They have similar population sizes, approximately regular shapes, avoid mixing urban/rural postcodes, and are bound to a minimum size to retain confidentiality.\n So instead, I downloaded all the .csv spreadsheets from the bulk data download! I know, not ideal given it\u0026rsquo;s 5.5 GB but if you want to look across a range of demographics and localities then this is the process I\u0026rsquo;d recommend. You do then have to do a bit of detective work to figure out what is in each sheet (a look-up table would be very handy!).\n The Scotland Census table is easier to use at a local authority level, especially as it saves your previous selections - making multiple data downloads easier.\n The flexible table builder for the 2022 census table looks a lot more user friendly so this process should be more streamlined when the next data set is released!\nScotland census data wrangling   Figure out what cut of the data you want to look at. In this blog I want to look at the breakdown of people with one or more long-term health conditions by output area.\n  Go to the Scotland Census website, search by topic and look for that breakdown. Under the title is an alpha-numeric code, this code relates to the name of the .csv file in the bulk data download.\n  \rHaving searched for and found the relevant .csv file, upload this into R - remembering to move the file into your R folder!  library(tidyverse)\rlibrary(sf)\rlibrary(rmapshaper)\rlibrary(leaflet)\rHealth \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;data/QS304SC.csv\u0026quot;)\rEventually we are going to merge this file with a shapefile for the output areas, I\u0026rsquo;m cheating a little with this step-by-step guide as we haven\u0026rsquo;t yet imported (or downloaded) the shapefile but spoiler alert we want to rename the column that contains the output area code.  \rHealth \u0026lt;- Health %\u0026gt;% rename('code' = X1)\rWhat I want to do is look at the absolute number of people with one or more long-term health conditions, and how this translates as a percentage of the output area population.  Health_df1 \u0026lt;-\rHealth %\u0026gt;% group_by(code) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(abnum = `One or more conditions`,\rpct = round(abnum / `All people` *100, 1)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(code, abnum, pct)\rNow the data is wrangled we will need some geographical coordinates for the output areas to make a map. I downloaded the coastline clipped version of the output area shapefile from the National Records of Scotland.  \rOALayer \u0026lt;-\rst_read(\u0026quot;data/OutputArea2011_MHW.shp\u0026quot;,\rlayer = \u0026quot;OutputArea2011_MHW\u0026quot;)\rOALayer \u0026lt;-\rst_transform(OALayer, \u0026quot;+init=epsg:4326\u0026quot;)\rI also use rmapshaper to simplify the shapefiles, just for quicker loading/rendering as the exact boundaries aren\u0026rsquo;t too important to me at this stage.  SimpleOA \u0026lt;-\rms_simplify(OALayer) For this I am only going to look at the Ayrshires (North, South, and East) so rather than merge the entire shapefile and data, I filter the shapefile to the council codes of interest (I used this table to find the council codes). When the two files are merged it\u0026rsquo;ll only merge the output areas for the filtered councils.  \rAyrshireOA \u0026lt;- SimpleOA %\u0026gt;% filter(council == c('S12000008', 'S12000021',\r'S12000028'))\rHealth_shp \u0026lt;- merge(AyrshireOA, Health_df1, by='code')\rAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! Nice and simple, right?\nI know this probably seems like a lot of work and prep to get to this stage, but once you\u0026rsquo;ve put in the initial effort you will be set up to just switch out the census data.\nAnd I promise it\u0026rsquo;ll all be worth the effort!\nMapping those with long-term health conditions Before adding in the polling station data I think we\u0026rsquo;ve earned a map to look at - so first we\u0026rsquo;ll map the census data.\n We\u0026rsquo;ll need to define a palette -  bin \u0026lt;-\rcolorBin('Oranges', domain = Health_shp$abnum)\rThen we can build the map! I\u0026rsquo;m calling up the data in addPolygon() and addLegend() because my intention is to later add further layers from different data sources.   There are much better resources out there for learning the in\u0026rsquo;s and out\u0026rsquo;s of the leaflet package, my intention is for you to be able to see the basics of this code being applied to this data set.\n map \u0026lt;- leaflet() %\u0026gt;%\raddTiles() %\u0026gt;%\raddPolygons(data = Health_shp, color= \u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;, weight = 0.75, smoothFactor = 0.5, opacity = 1.0,\rfillColor = ~ bin(abnum), fillOpacity = 1, popup = ~paste(abnum),\rhighlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, weight = 1)\r) %\u0026gt;%\raddLegend(data = Health_shp, \u0026quot;bottomright\u0026quot;, pal = bin, values = ~ abnum, title = \u0026quot;Absolute number \u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; of long-term illness \u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; population\u0026quot;, opacity = 0.6 )\rmap\r\rPolling Station data Now we know where people with a long-term health condition live across Ayrshire, let\u0026rsquo;s see how this relates to polling stations from the 2021 Scottish Government election.\n Disabled people are more likely to vote by post (35%) compared to non-disabled people (19%).\n  The polling station data for Scotland is downloaded from the spatiial hub and imported into R.  \rPollLayer \u0026lt;-\rst_read(\u0026quot;data/pub_polpl.shp\u0026quot;, layer = \u0026quot;pub_polpl\u0026quot;)\rPollLayer \u0026lt;-\rst_transform(PollLayer, \u0026quot;+init=epsg:4326\u0026quot;) Then the polling stations are filtered to only those in Ayrshire.  Ayrshire_Poll \u0026lt;- PollLayer %\u0026gt;% filter(local_auth %in% c('North Ayrshire', 'South Ayrshire', 'East Ayrshire'))\rAnd finally we can add these to our map.  map %\u0026gt;%\raddCircleMarkers(data = Ayrshire_Poll)\r\rHow do we use this? We know that:\n Disabled people are less likely to use public transport; And those with long-term health conditions are more likely to make short public transport journeys only. People with a long-term health condition are also less likely to have access to a vehicle (46% no car/van compared to 19% of those with no illness).   Transport Scotland have an insightful summary on some of the barriers for disabled people using public transport\n Of course, not all disabled people encounter barriers to travelling; however, in areas with high numbers of people with long-term illness and no nearby polling station:\n what is the voting rate of the general output area population? what is the voting rate of those with long-term health conditions?  And then across Ayrshire -\n do areas with high absolute and relative numbers of people with long-term health conditions that also have polling stations, have higher voting rates?  If voting rates are comparably lower amongst those with long-term health conditions and no local polling stations, could this indicate the locations of the polling stations aren\u0026rsquo;t accessible to all?\n In 2017, those with limiting health conditions were less likely to confidently report they would vote in the upcoming UK General Election.\n I should also state two other things:\n  I have no idea how the decision to locate polling stations is actually made, I imagine population figures and availability of suitable buildings plays a large role. I\u0026rsquo;m using this data as an example only!\n  Just because a polling station is physically located in an accessible place, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the building nor the voting process itself is accessible\n  Polling stations can be replaced with any building, facility, or provision that is of interest, and the underlying census data can be a range of different demographics.\nThis post is intended to provide a guide on how census can be an insightful tool when we want to build opportunities that intend to serve communities; by taking that first step and asking where and how? Where are the people we want to engage? And how do we reduce/remove any barriers to ensure equitable access to our service?\nSummary image by frank mckenna on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://niccipotts.netlify.app/blog/pollingstations/","tags":["R","Mapping","GIS"],"title":"Census data for person centered design"},{"categories":["Sport \u0026 physical activity"],"contents":"Is Scotland becoming a more physically active nation? In short, yes-ish.\nIn this blog post I\u0026rsquo;m going to delve into Scotland\u0026rsquo;s physical activity levels by taking a high-level look at the Scottish Health Survey data. The trend lines from this data have remained fairly stable over time - a data point in itself!\nThis stability, however, can make the data easy to dismiss because \u0026lsquo;it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add anything new\u0026rsquo; or it \u0026lsquo;tells us what we already know\u0026rsquo;. But sometimes there is value in revisiting figures with a fresh perspective.\nAll views, analysis, and summaries in this post are my personal work and opinions. The R code for my data wrangling and plots can be found on my GitHub.\n The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that \u0026ldquo;up to 5 million deaths a year could be averted if the global population was more active\u0026rdquo;.\n The Scottish Health Survey runs every year, with the intention of monitoring the health of the nation. Participants are asked about their physical activity levels, which are then categorised into:\n meets recommendations some activity low activity very low activity.  In Scotland, to meet recommendations someone must do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity/week.\nAll the Scottish Health Survey data can be downloaded from the Scottish Health Survey data explorer.\n\rPhysical activity data from the survey is available from 2012 to 2019. Over this period, the proportion of the Scottish population meeting physical activity recommendations has seen a marginal increase; with a slight difference between females and males (+3% and +4%, respectively). This equates to roughly 218,000 more people meeting physical activity recommendations in 2019 compared to 2012.\n The Scottish Government estimate that low physical activity levels are attributed to 2,500 deaths/year and cost the NHS £94 million.\n Great, Scotland\u0026rsquo;s become a more active nation!\nOr has it?\n\rIf we look at the age group breakdown for those meeting physical activity recommendations we can note:\n With the exception of the 75+ year group, there is no statistically significant change in physical activity levels across age groups between 2012 and 2019 (errors not shown in figure). There is a correlation between increasing age and decreasing physical activity levels - i.e. people get less active as they get older. The only age group with \u0026lt;50% meeting physical activity recommendations is the 75+ - i.e. there is a considerable age related physical activity gap.  Based on population estimates, in 2019 there were 164,500 75+ year olds meeting physical activity recommendations - an increase of 59,500 since 2012. This accounts for 27% of the overall increase; the errors on the other age groups mean we can\u0026rsquo;t breakdown the remainder of this increase.\nScaling to population, the +10% increase from 2012 to 2019 in 75+ year olds meeting recommendations has a disproportionate impact on national figures. Meaning that on a whole, Scotland hasn\u0026rsquo;t become more active but over 75\u0026rsquo;s have!\n\rThe largest drops in physical activity levels, between age groups, is between 64-74 and 75+. If we assume people don\u0026rsquo;t just stop exercising the day they hit 75, then we can infer that, although in general people become less active as they age, they are also more likely to stop meeting physical activity recommendations between the ages of 65 and 74.\n The World Health Organisation recommend adults do at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or \u0026gt;75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity a week, and suggest exceeding these recommendations for additional health benefits.\n Research suggests that people who meet physical activity recommendations are more likely to live longer, healthier lives. Is it, therefore, fair to equate health issues alone for the large decrease in physical activity levels of 65-74 year olds?\nHave there been any historic shifts in lifestyles between the 1960\u0026rsquo;s and 1970\u0026rsquo;s that could equate for people who were in their 30\u0026rsquo;s in the 1970\u0026rsquo;s having fewer health issues/being more physically active than those who were in their 30\u0026rsquo;s in the 1960\u0026rsquo;s?\n\rThose with a limiting long-term illness are also less likely to meet physical activity recommendations, compared to those with non-limiting and no illness. And while this data isn\u0026rsquo;t broken down by age, we also know that people are more likely to develop long-term illness with old age. It maybe unsurprising then to see similar increases in physical activity levels for people with limiting long-term illness and the 75+ age group.\nThat said, the proportion of those with limiting long-term illness who meet physical activity recommendations is much higher than the 75+ group (by +20%).\n Scotland has an aging population. Increase in the older age groups has been much higher than younger age groups over the last 20 years. The largest increase has been in the 75+ age group (+31%).\n If these increases sustain, it could indicate a shift towards higher physical activity levels in those with limiting long-term illness and older age groups. While on a whole this might not lead to a more active Scotland, it will contribute to closing the health and age related physical activity gaps - creating a more equal* landscape.\n*note that I purposefully write equal and not equitable.\n\rI can\u0026rsquo;t touch on an equal physical activity landscape without mentioning equivalised income. Here I am only looking at physical activity levels for 2019, where income has been separated into quintiles (1st quintile = higher earners). There are no statistically significant changes between 2012 and 2019 for any of the quintiles.\nWe can note:\n There is a correlation between increasing quintile and increasing proportion of those meeting physical activity recommendations - i.e. higher earners are more likely to be active. There is a correlation between decreasing quintile and increasing proportion of very low activity - i.e. lower earns more likely to be inactive. The some and low activity are small contributors; people are in general either active or inactive.  There many articles and blog posts on the privileged notion of leisure time (I recommend this blog post by Zachary Watson  for a quick intro.). In short, those on lower paid incomes may have less leisure time due to working multiple jobs, non-typical shift patterns, and caring commitments. It is, therefore, unsurprising to see that lower earners are less likely to be physically active.\nIt is worth noting that without removing barriers and creating equality across income quintiles, when we talk about increasing physical activity levels we are, and will continue to be, talking about getting more affluent people active. This in itself is a fundamental barrier to increasing physical activity levels across Scotland. The proportion of higher earners meeting physical activity recommendations is already really high (78%), this doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave much room for improvement! To shift the national figures, Scotland will need to get lower earners more active.\n People of low socioeconomic status are more likely to have poorer health and shorter life expectancy than people of higher socioeconomic status, attributed in part to a lower prevalence of physical activity. Rawal et al. 2020.\n A final point worth noting is that while those meeting physical activity recommendations has increased by ~3%, between 2012 and 2019; the population of Scotland has also increased by ~2.7%.\nA large contributor to population growth in Scotland is migration; and so a key question may e how much has migration impacted Scotland\u0026rsquo;s longer term physical activity trends?\nTo summarise:\nHas Scotland become more physical activity? Maybe.\nIs Scotland closing the health and age related physical activity gap? Hopefully.\nWill Scotland be able to increase physical activity levels without closing the income related physical activity gap? Unlikely.\nSummary image by Sergio Souza from Pexels\n","permalink":"https://niccipotts.netlify.app/blog/physicalactivitylevels/","tags":["R","Physical activity","Social survey data"],"title":"Scotland's physical activity levels"},{"categories":["R"],"contents":"In this post I will breakdown creating maps from survey data in R, particularly focused on the Scottish Household Survey.\n The Scottish Household Survey (SHS) is an annual, cross-sectional survey run by the Scottish Government.

I then renamed the two column years I want to use - this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary I just find it easier to work with character variables!\nT6Q1 \u0026lt;- T6Q1 %\u0026gt;% rename(\u0026quot;local_auth\u0026quot; = Council,\r\u0026quot;twenty19\u0026quot; = `2019`,\r\u0026quot;twenty15\u0026quot; = `2015`)\rT7Q1 \u0026lt;- T7Q1 %\u0026gt;% rename(\u0026quot;local_auth\u0026quot; = Council,\r\u0026quot;twenty19\u0026quot; = `2019`,\r\u0026quot;twenty15\u0026quot; = `2015`) T10Q1 \u0026lt;- T10Q1 %\u0026gt;% rename(\u0026quot;local_auth\u0026quot; = Council,\r\u0026quot;twenty19\u0026quot; = `2019`,\r\u0026quot;twenty15\u0026quot; = `2015`)\rThen I\u0026rsquo;m going to change the spelling of a few local authorities to match the spelling in the shapefiles.\nT10Q1 \u0026lt;- transform(T10Q1, local_auth = sub(\u0026quot;\u0026amp;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;and\u0026quot;, local_auth))\rT10Q1 \u0026lt;- transform(T10Q1, local_auth = sub(\u0026quot;Edinburgh, City of\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;City of Edinburgh\u0026quot;, local_auth))\rT10Q1 \u0026lt;- transform(T10Q1, local_auth = sub(\u0026quot;Na h-Eileanan Siar\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Eilean Siar\u0026quot;, local_auth))\rNow my data is ready for me to investigate and start mapping!\n Prior to transforming the SHS data, I converted the shapefile into a dataframe then used distinct() to get the list of local authorities and their spelling.\n For my first map I want to see what proportion of each local authorities population agree that climate change is an immediate and urgent problem. I also want to see how perceptions have changed over time - I\u0026rsquo;m expecting to see an increase in people viewing climate change as a problem over a 5 year period.\nT10Q1_df1 \u0026lt;- T10Q1 %\u0026gt;% filter(X3 == 'Climate change is an immediate and urgent problem') %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(fiveyrdiff = twenty19-twenty15)\rIn the second map I\u0026rsquo;m interested in knowing what proportion of each local authority have access to home internet. Again, I want to see how this has changed over 5 years. Given the Scottish Government\u0026rsquo;s recent initative to increase broadband in rural areas of Scotland, I\u0026rsquo;m expecting to see lower internet access in the more rural local authorities.\nT7Q1_df1 \u0026lt;- T7Q1 %\u0026gt;% select(local_auth, twenty15, twenty19, `Internet Access`) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(`Internet Access` == 'Yes') %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(fiveyrdiff = twenty19-twenty15)\rFor the final map I only downloaded data for those who had responded that they were managing well financially. And again I wanted to see how this has changed over time.\nT6Q1_df1 \u0026lt;- T6Q1 %\u0026gt;% select(local_auth, Status, twenty15, twenty19) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(fiveyrdiff = twenty19-twenty15)\rThe final stage of data wrangling, once I\u0026rsquo;m happy my dataframes have the parameters I want to map, is to merge these with the local authority shape files.\nT6Q1_map \u0026lt;- merge(SimpleLA, T6Q1_df1, by= 'local_auth')\rCreating the map Now my data is downloaded, imported, and wrangled I\u0026rsquo;m ready to start making maps!!\n For this blog I\u0026rsquo;m using the tmap package, if I was creating these maps for a Shiny App I\u0026rsquo;d use the leaflet package instead due to the added interactive element.\n To create the map for the 2019 data, I tell tmap what data I want to use, then add polygons defining the data and a palette.\ntm_shape(T6Q1_map) +\rtm_polygons(col = \u0026quot;twenty19\u0026quot;,\rpalette = \u0026quot;PuBuGn\u0026quot;,\rtitle = '2019'\r)\rTo map the five year difference, I just change the column name.\ntm_shape(T6Q1_map) +\rtm_polygons(col = \u0026quot;fiveyrdiff\u0026quot;, palette = \u0026quot;RdBu\u0026quot;,\rtitle = '5 yr change',\r)  To switch to any of the other topics I\u0026rsquo;d just change the data under tm_shape() to T7Q1 or T10Q1 - remembering to create a merged shape file for each topic!\n One of the great things about tmap is it\u0026rsquo;s rooted in ggplot, which means there is lots of opportunity for customisation. As I\u0026rsquo;m creating multiple maps it\u0026rsquo;s easier to write a function with the layout settings.\nmap_theme2 \u0026lt;- function() {\rtm_layout(\rframe = TRUE,\rbg.color = '#c95b0c',\r\u0026quot; Manages \\n very well \\n financially\u0026quot;,\rtitle.color = 'white',\rtitle.size = 3,\rlegend.bg.color = TRUE,\rlegend.frame = FALSE,\rlegend.title.color = 'white',\rfontfamily = 'dosis',\rlegend.position = c(\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;),\rlegend.text.color = 'white',\rlegend.text.size = 0.7\r) +\rtm_credits(\r\u0026quot;Scottish Household Survey | @nicci_potts\u0026quot;,\rposition = c(\u0026quot;right\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;),\rcol = 'white',\rsize = 0.8,\ralign = 'right'\r)\r}\rAnd then the complete code for the map is below.\ntm_shape(T6Q1_map) +\rtm_polygons(col = \u0026quot;twenty19\u0026quot;,\rpalette = \u0026quot;PuBuGn\u0026quot;,\rtitle = '2019',\rlabels = c(\r'45 to 50 %',\r'50 to 55 %',\r'55 to 60 %',\r'60 to 65 %',\r'65 to 70 %',\r'70 to 75 %'\r),\rlwd = .25,\rborder.col = 'gray20'\r) + map_theme2()\rThere you have it! Six different maps from Scottish Household Survey data using one set of shapefiles and a couple of downloaded csv files! Maps are a great way of bringing data to life. For me, seeing a stark colour contrast between local authorities jumps out quicker than if I was looking at a bar plot of all 32 local authorities.\nAnd having access to the depth of data about Scotland\u0026rsquo;s households builds a deeper understanding of the nation we live in and helps a range of sectors target their provision.\nPeople\u0026rsquo;s perceptions on climate change or their access to internet may seem relevant to only very specific scenarios. However, socio-economic factors have wide ranging impacts. In the sporting context, the move towards online coaching delivery may equate to disproportionate access to information across local authorities. Or a push to get more people using active travel may have greater impact in local authorities more concerned about climate change.\nSummary image by Annie Spratt on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://niccipotts.netlify.app/blog/pamapping/","tags":["R","Mapping","GIS"],"title":"Mapping social survey data"}]
