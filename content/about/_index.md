I've created this website as a way to share my personal delves into data analysis and visualisation using R. 

I'm interested in using social data to improve people's lives and daily experiences, particularly around sport/physical activity. I'm currently working in the public sector but all views on this blog are entirely my own. I've included more information on my background with data below. 

> PhD Scientist, with multidisiplinary research experience. Currently working for a public body, helping others use data for planning and improvement.

I've had probably an unconventional career path but at the heart of everything I've done has been data. I started off as a geology undergraduate, which led me to a masters in geochemistry, that opened the door to a PhD in planetary science, which allowed me to dip my academic toes into some interdisciplinary research crossing the borders of astrophysics, planetary science, geology, and material science.

> Experience in R, Python, Matlab, QGIS, C++.

I was fortunate to be given time and space to develop and hone my skills throughout my education and career. Starting with C++ modelling during my masters gave me the confidence to tackle Matlab and Python during my PhD/PDRA. From there I moved to R, with a particular recent focus on Shiny Apps. 

Having left academia in 2018, I lived 'the dream' working freelance out of the back of my campervan travelling around Scotland. During this time I was fortunate to work on a wide variety of projects with people from across the globe.

> Applied my skills to a range of topics and disciplines. Always keen to learn something new!

This included; developing astrophysics lectures for online learning, building models in R for academic research, ghost writing a cookery book, analysing GIS data, providing scientific advice on method development, and proofreading a lot of papers! During this time I also worked at a mountain bike center and then an indoor snow slope. 


Having settled on the West Coast of Scotland, I've entered the public sector. I'm really passionate about helping bring innovate insights and solutions using data, as well as bridging the gap for those lacking data confidence. 

In my free time I chair the Ayrshire Sportsability board, a disability sport charity providing opportunities for all disabled people in Ayrshire.

> Passionate about using data for good - the more we know, the more targeted the interventions, the more successfull our outcomes can be!

I am a keen crossfitter, powerlifter, and runner. I am a qualified snowboard and ski instructor, recreational kayaker and enjoy walking up munros when the weather and time allow.

When I'm not thinking about sport for work or fun, I can be found adventuring around Scotland with my dog Magpie. I've also recently dedicated myself to becoming more of a reader and always looking for recommendations.
